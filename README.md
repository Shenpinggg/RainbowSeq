# RainbowSeq
Core scripts for automatically gating in RainbowSeq.
The workflow for gating includes loading and pre-processing of image data (.tif) and FACS data (.fcs), clustering of pixels in image, mapping cells and pixels via "optimal transport", design for gating via "CART tree" and finally constructing the gate file (.xml) for cell sorting.
